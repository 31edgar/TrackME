## Description
TrackME is a to-do list application built with Java Swing. Its goal is to be as simple as it is useful. It focuses on daily progress through habit completion, helping users build a strong foundation of discipline.

## Versions
### Latest version: 1.1
I managed to implement another way to check your progress: **Calendar View**. I believe that having different systems to review your progress is essential to stay motivated and keep working hard.

In this case, there are two views:
+ **Habit View**: allows you to track which days you have completed each habit
+ **Calendar View**: provides a summary of all habits completed on a specific day

So far, it only includes default habits that cannot be changed. I'm currently working on a system that will allow users to add their own custom habits.

!! - This is a VERY early version, so it only has a few features.
